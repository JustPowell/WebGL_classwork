The object files are represented by the mesh(n).txt files the base folder. Within the blenderfiles folder
are the actual blender objects. 

To change which object is drawn select the appropriate object from the drop down menu. 

Something is buggy with this version of code that is causing complex objects to be drawn funky. I'm working
on fixing that at the moment.
